	abstract = {A number of powerful demographic inference methods have been developed in recent years, with the goal of fitting rich evolutionary models to genetic data obtained from many populations. In this paper we investigate the statistical performance of these methods in the specific case where there is continuous migration between populations. Compared with earlier work, migration significantly complicates the theoretical analysis and requires new techniques. We employ the theories of phase-type distributions and concentration of measure in order to study the two-island and isolation-with-migration models, resulting in both upper and lower bounds on rates of convergence for parametric estimators in migration models. For the upper bounds, we consider inferring rates of coalescent and migration on the basis of directly observing pairwise coalescent times, and, more realistically, when (conditionally) Poisson-distributed mutations dropped on latent trees are observed. We complement these upper bounds with information-theoretic lower bounds which establish a limit, in terms of sample size, below which inference is effectively impossible.},

	abstract = {A common workflow in data exploration is to learn a low-dimensional representation of the data, identify groups of points in that representation, and examine the differences between the groups to determine what they represent. We treat this workflow as an interpretable machine learning problem by leveraging the model that learned the low-dimensional representation to help identify the key differences between the groups. To solve this problem, we introduce a new type of explanation, a Global Counterfactual Explanation (GCE), and our algorithm, Transitive Global Translations (TGT), for computing GCEs. TGT identifies the differences between each pair of groups using compressed sensing but constrains those pairwise differences to be consistent among all of the groups. Empirically, we demonstrate that TGT is able to identify explanations that accurately explain the model while being relatively sparse, and that these explanations match real patterns in the data.},
