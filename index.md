### About us
We are a group of statisticians, mathematicians, and computer scientists
broadly interested in statistical and probabilistic models of biological data. To date, our work 
has mainly centered on problems arising in evolutionary biology, but we are always keen to learn
about new areas and help other scientists understand their data. Please get in touch if this sounds like you!
