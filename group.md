To paraphrase [a former mentor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Patterson_(computer_scientist)), "in academia, good graduate students are the coin of the realm." I have had the immense fortune to work with these fantastic students and postdocs, and am always looking to add more talented and hard-working students to my group.
